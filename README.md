# Inflation Analysis in the US Economy

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes **inflation trends in the US economy (2014â€“2023)** across multiple sectors, including **Energy, Education, Apparel, Food and Beverages, Alcoholic Beverages, Housing, Medical Care, and Electricity**. The objective is to understand both **short-term fluctuations** and **long-term drivers** of inflation through descriptive statistics and time series analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Measure and compare inflation trends across key sectors.
* Identify high-volatility sectors and structural inflation drivers.
* Decompose inflation into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
* Provide insights to support **economic forecasting and policy analysis**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

* **Source:** Consumer Price Index (CPI) data (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
* **Time Frame:** 2014â€“2023
* **Sectors Included:**

  * Energy
  * Education
  * Apparel
  * Food & Beverages
  * Alcoholic Beverages
  * Housing
  * Medical Care
  * Electricity

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, forecast, stats
* **Methods:**

  * Descriptive statistics (mean, variance, growth rates)
  * Time series decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)
  * Visualization of sector-wise inflation changes

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Combined CPI data for 2014â€“2023.
   * Filtered for selected sectors.
   * Standardized time-series format.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**

   * Sector-wise inflation distributions.
   * Comparative trends across years.

3. **Time Series Analysis**

   * Decomposed CPI series into trend/seasonal components.
   * Evaluated volatility and long-term drivers.

---

## âœ… Results

* **Energy** and **Food & Beverages** showed the **highest volatility**.
* **Housing** and **Medical Care** were steady **long-term drivers** of inflation.
* Seasonal patterns were most visible in **Apparel** and **Energy** prices.
* Overall, inflation accelerated post-2020, largely driven by **Energy** and **Housing** sectors.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements

* Incorporate **forecasting models** (ARIMA, Prophet, VAR).
* Extend dataset to **post-2023** for recent inflation shocks.
* Conduct **fairness analysis** of inflation impacts on different demographics.
